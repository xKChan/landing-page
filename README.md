# landing-page

The landing page project was truly an amazing experience to try and build.  It was hard at the start as this was the first real page
we built in TOP that had heavy css.  I initially added all the html onto the document first with placeholder text and images.  After that 
I went onto styling the html with some css flexbox.  This is where the real struggle came through.  

Problems I had:
    getting the items to be positioned how I wanted to
    Image sizes not being the size I wanted.. If i changed the size it would mess up the flexbox container layout.
    Text not wrapping properly

In the end I learned a lot from this project and while I am still not that good at flexbox, it is a learning experience and over time  I will 
get better with it to the point where I can position items where I want them to be. 

Will come back and touch up on this project after going through some more courses on TOP.
